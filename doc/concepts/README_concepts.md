# Concepts

  This folder contains instructive working examples of the used concepts. Each
  folder eludes a single concept in simplified form. You can understand the
  involved mechanisms without the clutter of the whole workflow.

  Use these as sandbox to play around and try things that may be too complex
  for a full-blown implementation at the first shot.
