# Requirements

  To run this workflow, you need to

  * have `conda` available,
  * have a `Snakemake` >=5.0 installed in your current environment, and
  * `$PYTHONPATH` must not be set.

  The workflow promises

  * to NOT modify the outside environment (e.g. by installing packages), and
  * to take care of all required dependencies internally.


# Installing

   ```bash
   # wget https://...miniconda3.sh
   # bash miniconda3.sh
   # conda install pip
   # which pip
   .../miniconda3/bin/pip
   # pip install snakemake
   # snakemake --version
   5.4.4
   ```
