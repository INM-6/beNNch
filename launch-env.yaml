# This is the environment from where the jobs are launched, basically by
# calling JUBE. This envrionment is usually necessary on the cluster head node.
# The run environment in many cases inherits packages from here, depending on
# how the batch submissionis set up. The run environment may also be set up
# separately by the job (e.g. via `module load`).
